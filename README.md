# Welcome to Basic-App

This is a basic practice app I made in order to prepare for larger projects that will also use React Native for frontend development

## Running the app

I made this app for an iOS system, so in order to run it you must have a macOS system or, have the Expo Go app installed on your iOS device

### Windows
   
   Then run (in terminal):
      npm expo start --tunnel

   With the Expo Go app on your phone scan the QR code
   
### macOS
   In terminal run:
      npx expo run

   And select iOS/Android
